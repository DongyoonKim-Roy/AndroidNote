# Adapter
It is a bridge between the UI components (like `ListView`, `GridView`, RecyclerView`, etc.) and **the data source** that fills those UI components with content.

# Key Tasks
- Mapping data to views : Adapters take data from a data source (like an array, list, or database) and convert each item in that data source into a view that can be displayed in a UI component.
- Managing the view creation : Adapters are responsible for creating and recycling the views for the UI components efficiently.
