# MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)
- MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing applications, especially when building user interfaces.
- It helps organize and structure code in a way that separates concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

# Component of the MVVM pattern 
  ## Model
  - Definition
    - Represents the data and business logic of the application.
    - It is responsible for managing the data and rules of the application.
  - Functionality
    - The model can be thought of as the part of the code that handles data retrieval, storage, and business rules.
    - It is independent of the UI and provides data to the ViewModel in a format that can be easily consumed.
