# Dependency Injection (DI)
- It is a pattern used to manage the dependencies of classes to promote better code structure and scalability.
- It helps developers create more maintainable, testable, and modular applications.

# Why Dependency Injection?
**Decoupling**
- DI decouples components, like Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels, from the logic of how dependencies are created.

**Testability**
- Injecting dependencies makes it easy to use mock objects for unit testing, leading to more reliable test coverage.

**Reusability and Scalability**
- DI makes code easier to reuse and maintain by promoting a clean architecture.

# Common DI Frameworks
**Dagger**
- Compile-time DI.
- It is powerful but can have a steeper learning curve due to its extensive use of annotations and code generation.

**Hilt**
- Built on top of Dagger, Hilt simplifies DI and integrates well with the Android lifecycle.
- It's easier to set up and use than Dagger.

**Koin**
- A lightweight, Kotlin-based DI framework taht is easy to set up and use, making ti a good alternative to Dagger/Hilt
