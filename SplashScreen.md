# Key Characteristics of a Good Splash View
- Simple Design
  - It should be clean and minimal, forten featuring just a logo or app name. Too much information can negatively impact the experience.
- Brief Duration
  - It should only last for a few seconds - long enough to load the app's initial resources. If it takes too long, it can frustrate users.
- Smooth Transition
  - After the splash screen, the app should smoothly transition to the main screnn or content.

# Downsides of Splash View
- Unnecessary Wait Time.
- Overuse of Branding.
