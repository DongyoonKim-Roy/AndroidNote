# android: exported="false"
- It is used to specify whether an app component can be **accessed by other apps**.
- This attribute is critical for defining the **security behavior of app's components**.

# What does `android:exported="false"` mean
- `android:exported="false"` : It means that the component **cannot be accessed by any other app**.

# Why use `android:exported="false"`
- Security : It prevents other apps from directly launching or accessing internal components of apps.
- Limiting External Access : Some components (background activities or services) are not meant to be exposed or triggered by other apps, so `android:exported="false"` ensures that they remain intermal.
