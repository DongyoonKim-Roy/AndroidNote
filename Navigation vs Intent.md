# Navigation vs Intent
- Both of Navigation and Intent are used for transitioning between different screens or activities, but they serve different purposes and offer distinct features.

# Intent
- An `Intent` is an object used to **start an activity**, send a broadcast, or start a service.
- There are two types of intent, explicit and implicit.

## Example
`Explicit Intent`
```kt
val intent = Intent(this, MainActivity::class.java)
intent.putExtra("key", "value) // Passing data
startActivity(intent)
```
- It is used to start a specific activity within the same app.

`Implicit Intent`
```kt
val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
intent.data = Uri.parse("https://www.example.com")
startActivity(intent)
```
- It is used to perform an action, such as opening a URL in a browser or sending an email, without specifying the target component.

# Navigation
- It provides a framework for navigating within an app, including between fragments and activities, with a focus on handling complex navigation flows.
- It refers to the Android Jetpack `Navigation Component`.

## Example
```kt
findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_currentFragment_to_nextFragment)
```
- Navigation is defined in a `navigation graph` that outlines the app's navigation paths, destinations (fragments or activities), and actions.
- Use `NavController` and `NavHostFragment` to manage navigation within fragments.

# Pros and Cons
## Intent
**Pros**
- Simple and starightforward for navigating between activities.
- Can pass data using `extras`.
- Supports both explicit and implicit navigation.

**Cons**
- Navigating with `Intents` is less structured and can result in complex code when handling multiple screens and navigation flows.
- Passing complex data can require additional work for serialization and data handling.

## Navigation
**Pros**
- Provides a structured and visual way to handle navigation.
- Reduces boilerplate code and makes back stack handling simpler.
- Safer argument passing between fragments with type safety using Safe Args.
- Ideal for managing complex fragment-based navigation.

**Cons**
- Slight learning curve for those new to JetPack components.
- Requires additional setup, including a navigation graph and dependencies.

# Key Differences
## Purpose
**Intent**
- It is mainly used for starting activities, services, and broadcasts.
**Navigation**
- It is used for managing in-app navigation, especially with fragments, in a structured and organized way.

## Complexity
**Intent**
- It is more straightforward and better suited for simpler navigation tasks between activities.
**Navigation**
- It is designed for more complex navigation flows, particularly when using fragments and handling back stacks and deep links.

## Data Passing
**Intent**
- It passes data using `putExtra()` and `getExtra()`, which can become error-prone when handling complex data types.
**Navigation**
- It ensures type-safe data passing between destinations with Safe Args.

## Back Stack Management
**Intent**
- It requires manual handling of the back stack which can be more complex when managing nested activities.
**Navigation**
- It automatically manages the back stack and handles navigation actions like popping and replacing fragments.

## Deep Linking
**Intent**
- It supports deep linking but may require custom logic for parsing and handling URIs.
**Navigation**
- It natively supporys deep linking with seamless integration into the navigation graph.
